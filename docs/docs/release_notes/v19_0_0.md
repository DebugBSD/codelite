## Changes

---

- [Find next shortcut doesn't work while Find/replace dialog is focused][2]
- Fixed: quick find bar: replace all not working as expected when the `find what` is a subset of "replace with" Fixed: build error (CI, MSW)
- Fixed: `Replace All` in selection
- Find bar: enable the "Replace with" field when "In Selection" is checked
- Fixed: under `Windows 11`: side bar icons are dimmed (when dark mode is used)
- Better terminal colours for builds with `wxWidgets` version lower than `3.3`
- Use better colour for drawing default text in the build output pane Build output view: do not centre on the clicked line, unless the operation came from the keyboard (e.g. user hit ++f4++)
- Matching brace highlight is now done faster, this is done by reducing the idle event interval to min of `100ms`
- Highlight word: minor performance improvement: check that we have marker before clearing the markers
- Configurable "Find next"/"Find previous" behaviour when the "Find" dialog is not visible (#3570)
- Find dialog: user can now use the arrows (up/down) to toggle through the previous searches / replacements
- [CodeLite doesn't detect existing mingw-w64 installations][3]
